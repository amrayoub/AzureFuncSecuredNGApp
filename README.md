# AzureFuncSecuredNGApp

This is a sample applicaiton and code that accompanies a blog post.  For full details and instructions, please see my blog post series on [Securing Azure Functions with Azure Active Directory ](https://peteskelly.com/secure-functions-aad-1/)This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.  

To begin, clone the repository and install local packages using yarn or npm. For example:

```
yarn install
``` 

Once you have the packages installed locally, update the ```configuration.service.ts``` file with your Azure Function App information. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
